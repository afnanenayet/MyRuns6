## Note
- The .apk file is provided in the root directory of this project. It is named "Afnan\_Enayet\_MyRuns5.apk"
- When you clicked the "Start" button for GPS or Automatic input, the first time it will request permissions. If you grant permissions, tap it again to open the activity.
- The implementation of this lab is built off of my submission in the previous assignment, MyRuns4. It can be treated as a direct extension/continuation of MyRuns4.
- I am using one of my 24 hour passes in order to submit this assignment. My other 24 hour pass was used on MyRuns4
- This apk was tested on my phone and worked fine. Please contact me if there are issues and I will be happy to let you test it on my phone.

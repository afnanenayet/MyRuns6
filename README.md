## Note
- The .apk file is provided in the root directory of this project. It is named "Afnan\_Enayet\_MyRuns6.apk"
- When you clicked the "Start" button for GPS or Automatic input, the first time it will request permissions. If you grant permissions, tap it again to open the activity.
- The implementation of this lab is built off of my submission in the previous assignment, MyRuns5. It can be treated as a direct extension/continuation of MyRuns5.
- This apk was tested on my phone and worked fine. Please contact me if there are issues and I will be happy to let you test it on my phone.
- At the time of writing, my production server is working fine. Link: http://myruns-1486240948224.appspot.com
- I re-used the ServerUtilities class from XD's example. He stated that this is ok on Piazza
